In this project, i have created an Excel Dashboard to extract valuable insights and KPI's from the Road Accident dataset which included the data related to number of casualties, road surface and other columns. I cleaned the data initially and then transformed it by making pivot tables and charts to show exact metrics and use them in the dashboard, which consisted of various interactive elements, including charts, graphs and slicers to get insights as per the requirement.
